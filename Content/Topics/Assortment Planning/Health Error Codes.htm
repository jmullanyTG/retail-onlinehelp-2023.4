This process incorporates actualized data into sales plans and makes any necessary adjustments. It is important that actual data is up-to-date in AP before making any subsequent changes to sales plans.</td>

                    <td class="TableStyle-standard-BodyE-Column2-Body1">The Total Sales metric is less than the Actualized Sales metric. Since Total Sales represents the lifetime of the item, adding Actualized Sales and Future Sales together, Total Sales should always be the greater number. This circumstance only occurs if there were some unexpected data condition (like extremely negative sales values in actualized data). There are many defenses in the application to prevent this from happening.</td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-standard-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Modify Total Sales to be greater than Actualized Sales, and Save. The Actualized Sales and Total Sales values can exactly match (and these values should match after the item has phased out), but there can be conflicts if entering in the exact Actualized Sales value into Total Sales and there are unrounded decimals not visible in the screen, so the value should be increased by 1.</td>

                    <td class="TableStyle-standard-BodyE-Column2-Body1">There are periods in the sales plan where there are no sites for the cluster set / cluster. This occurs because the cluster set snapshot active for the period contains no sites, or all of the sites in the cluster have been marked as closed. A sales, receipt, and inventory plan cannot exist where there are no sites.</td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-standard-BodyD-Column1-Body1">There are multiple actions to take to resolve this error. Reevaluate the cluster set snapshots over time, ensuring that all clusters have the right membership of sites. Reevaluate site status information, ensuring at least one site is open for each period of time during the life of the placeholder. If the cluster is truly meant to have no sites for some time (such as a cluster has been removed or added), then change the AP plan to exclude the time where the cluster doesn't exist. This can be done by changing phase dates of the placeholder to not include the periods where the cluster is empty, or un-assorting from the cluster altogether using the Cluster Details pane.</td>

This process prunes old data out of data tables to reclaim space in the database. How far out the data is pruned is governed by a system policy (which can also disable this feature altogether). It is important that expiration run weekly so that the expected amount of data is present in the sales plan.</td>

If all periods were opted out in error, then the user should opt some periods back in as selling. If the periods are marked as non-selling due to having no sites in the cluster, then actions should be taken to correct cluster definitions (see the Cluster Zero Site Count error). If the item is meant to not be in phase yet, set the phase dates accordingly. If the placeholder should never be sold for the cluster, rather than opting out each period individually, the assortment should be removed using the Cluster Details pane.</td>
