        <h1>Assortment Planning</h1>
        <h2>Enhancements to Target Creation</h2>
        <p>TG JE v2023.4 introduces new metrics allowing users to view the approximate average stock per choice These metrics are identical for Target Creation in both AP mode and standalone Target Choice Count mode.</p>
        <p>For information, see the <cite>Target Choice Count</cite> section.</p>
        <h2>Improved stock to sales threshold formatting</h2>
        <p>Formatting has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Receipt Plan</span> view and the <span class="Emphasis">Sales Plan</span> view so that the <span class="Emphasis">Stock To Sales</span> column will have red text if the value is below the default lower threshold or above the default upper threshold.</p>
        <h2>Viewing Product Code and/or Product Description in product hierarchy dropdown</h2>
        <p>The product selection dropdown in Placeholder and Collection views can be configured to display 1. just the product description, 2. just the product code, or 3. the product code and description. Which fields to display is set using system policy <span class="Emphasis">Product Level Display</span> (Module: Assortment).</p>
        <h2>Planning discount/promotion rates that update the AUR</h2>
        <p>A new feature allows users to plan an AUT Discount percentage (Rate). This discount rate can be planned on its own, or in conjunction with specific planned promotions within AP This allows users to manage item-level AURs without using the Promotions view in AP. </p>
        <p>The plannable metric, AUT Discount % allows a user to plan a discount percentage which is not otherwise defined through specific promotions.  The reduction in AUT is then applied against the AUT and used to update the planned AUR. This eliminates the need to plan the AUR.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">AUT (average unit ticket) is the ticket price, and AUR (average unit retail) is the retail price paid by the customer. </p>
        <p>For example, if the AUT is $100, and various promos, etc., cause that variant to go out the door at an average AUR of $80, a user might plan a discount or promotion rate of 20%, and that would update the planned AUR.</p>

                        <p>This metric is agnostic of the discount source - be it the planned AUT Discount % or specific promotions themselves. Users may plan future periods by using specific promotions to plan the discount, or use the AUT Discount %, or both - but be aware that the AUT +/- % AUR metric is reflective of all of these discount sources, combined.</p></td>
