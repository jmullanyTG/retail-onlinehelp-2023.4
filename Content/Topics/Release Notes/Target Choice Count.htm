        <h2><a name="2023.2TCC"></a>2023.2</h2>
        <h3>Configuring which clusters and cluster sets get more choices than others</h3>
        <p>To define a nested relationship for assortment choice counts, TG&#160;JE v2023.2 introduces functionality that lets users specify which clusters and cluster sets should always have more choices than others.  The hierarchical configuration can be at the cluster level or at the cluster set level or both, depending on how users create segments and clusters.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Target Creation Cluster Configuration.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Select the new <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Config</span> button added to the toolbar to display the <span class="Emphasis">Target Item Master Group Cluster Configuration</span> screen. Two new screen sections, <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Containment Configuration</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Set Containment Configuration</span>, added to this view allow users to specify which clusters and/or cluster sets should always have more choices than others.
</p>
        <p>In the above screen shot,   

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Cluster A</span> will have more choices than <span class="Emphasis">Cluster B</span>, which will have more choices than <span class="Emphasis">Cluster C</span>.
</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Retail Cluster Set</span> set will always have more choices than <span class="Emphasis">E-Com Cluster Set</span>, which will have more choices than <span class="Emphasis">Outlet Cluster Set</span>. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If clusters:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>are unique across cluster sets (e.g. cluster <span class="Emphasis">E-Com</span> only occurs in <span class="Emphasis">E-Com Cluster Set</span> or cluster <span class="Emphasis">A</span> only occurs in <span class="Emphasis">Retail Cluster Set</span>), then it is sufficient to use the <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Containment Configuration</span> section only.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>are not hierarchical in nature (e.g. clusters are Warm Weather versus Cold Weather or East Coast versus West Coast), then use <span class="Emphasis">Cluster Set Containment Configuration</span> only.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>are repeated in cluster sets, and cluster sets have some hierarchical nature to them (e.g. <span class="Emphasis">Retail Cluster Set</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Outlet Cluster Set</span> both contain <span class="Emphasis">A</span>,<span class="Emphasis"> B</span>, and <span class="Emphasis">C</span> clusters), then use both sections as they can be used jointly.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Using cluster containment configurations in scenarios</h4>
        <p>To use a cluster containment configuration in a scenario, select the checkbox in the new <span class="Emphasis">Use Cluster Constraint</span> field added to the segment configuration section.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Use Cluster Constraint.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>This checkbox can be selected when Target Creation is accessed via the Assortment Planning module, or when in standalone Target Choice Count mode with <span class="Emphasis">Cluster</span> as the specified Site Aggregation Level.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">System policy <span class="Emphasis">Default: Use Cluster Constraint</span> determines whether the <span class="Emphasis">Use Cluster Constraint</span> field is checked or unchecked when new segments are created or generated.</p>
        <h4>Reviewing a constrained recommended choice count</h4>
        <p>A new metric labeled <span class="Emphasis">TY Constrained Recommended New Choices</span> has been added to the Target Worksheet tab. This field shows the recommended choice count after it has been through cluster constraining as configured in the <span class="Emphasis">Target Item Master Group Cluster Configuration</span> screen.  If the constrained choice count differs from the recommended choice count, the text is formatted blue.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Constrained Recommended Choice Count.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>If a user changes the choices further (see <span class="Emphasis">TY ACT New Choices</span>), the text is formatted blue if the value is increased and red if the value is decreased.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">User-entered override choice count values are not included by the constrained logic. Cluster constraints are applied against system recommended choice counts. If using user-overrides, all clusters must be revised by the user as desired.</p>
        <h4>Breaking down the constrained recommended choice count by styles and colors</h4>
        <p>The new <span class="Emphasis">Results Matrix</span> tab displays the output of Rationalization which is the marginal return matrices generated for all segments, cluster sets, and clusters.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Results Matrix.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">To condense the view as above, right-click in the data grid and select the <span class="Emphasis">Best Fit Columns</span> menu option.
</p>
        <p>Whereas the <span class="Emphasis">TY Constrained Recommended New Choices</span> field shows a recommendation of 32 for Cluster A, the <span class="Emphasis">Results Matrix</span> breaks this down allowing users to see that the actual recommendation is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>1 style in 4 colors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>3 styles each in 3 colors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>7 styles each in 2 colors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>5 styles with their own color</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Results Matrix grid formatting</h4>
        <p>The formatting is as follows:

</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Green background, black text: choices as recommended by the Rationalization process; the count of these cells is consistent with the same-formatted <span class="Emphasis">TY Recommended New Choices</span> field in Target Worksheet.

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Green background, blue text: additional choices as recommended by the Constraint configuration; the count of these cells is consistent with the same formatted <span class="Emphasis">TY Constrained Recommended New Choices</span> field in Target Worksheet.

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Blue background, blue text: additional choices as specified by the user; the count of these cells is consistent with the same formatted <span class="Emphasis">TY Act New Choices</span> field in Target Worksheet.

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Gray background, red text: choices that were recommended by Rationalization and/or Constraint processes, but were removed due to a lower value entered in <span class="Emphasis">TY Act New Choices</span>. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Actual marginal return matrix values</h4>
        <p>

By default, the matrix shows the <span class="Emphasis">Ranking</span> field with its numerical ranking of matrix values.  To view the actual marginal return matrix values, add the <span class="Emphasis">Curve Value</span> field using the <span class="Emphasis">Fields</span> menu.  The matrix values are used to split the Target value across choices. For example, if this is the matrix for the first style:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Results Matrix Ratio.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>The ratio between matrix values is held in the ratio of TY sales values in the <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> tab:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Results Matrix Ratio New Choices Tab.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Thus, the matrix says that the second color in the collection will have 62.3% of the sales of the first color. In the <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> tab, the ratio between the second choice and first choice is 3,966 / 6,368 = 62.5%.</p>
        <h4>Specifying how collections are created and merged across cluster set / clusters</h4>
        <p>In Segment configuration, users can specify how placeholders are assigned and collections created by selecting a method in the <span class="Emphasis">Collection Option</span> field. For TG JE v2023.2, existing option <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Variants per Collection</span> has been renamed to <span class="Emphasis">Ascending Layering (Legacy)</span>. In addition to the existing 3 options, a new option <span class="Emphasis">Positional Merge</span> has been added. If <span class="Emphasis">Positional Merge</span> is selected, then collection assignments are merged according to their positions in the marginal return matrices. The result of collection assignments can be viewed in the <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> tab.</p>
        <p>Returning later to enable the Cluster Containment functionality by selecting  the <span class="Emphasis">Use Cluster Constraint</span> checkbox automatically sets the <span class="Emphasis">Collection Option</span> field to <span class="Emphasis">Positional Merge</span> when <span class="Emphasis">Save</span> is clicked.</p>
        <p>The default value for <span class="Emphasis">Collection Option</span> is set via new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Default: Collection Option</span>.  However, if a second new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Default: Use Cluster Constraint</span> is enabled, then the option must be set to <span class="Emphasis">Positional Merge</span>.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">For definitions and examples relating to the 4 collection options, refer to the TG JE v2023.2 Online Help, <cite>Assortment Planning User Guide</cite>, or <cite>Target Choice Count User Guide</cite>.</p>
        <h4>Using approximate stock quantities to assess recommended choices</h4>
        <p>Within the <span class="Emphasis">Target Worksheet</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> grids, recommended placeholders include Sales $ and Sales U targets. The stock needed to meet those Sales targets is not included in the Target Creation results due to Receipts being calculated later in the Assortment Planning process when other metrics such as Receipt eligible weeks, Presentation Minimums, Allow Receipts after Markdown, etc. are considered.</p>
        <p>However, visibility to an approximate receipt or stock plan would greatly help planners decide whether to proceed with a choice recommendation. For example, planners may have an idea of the number of sizes needed per placeholder as a setup quantity. Depending on the store count within a Cluster Set/Cluster and the number of sizes needed for a presentation, the recommended Sales might not justify buying that choice, because the stock needed to setup is much greater than the Sales potential.</p>
        <p>The target segment configuration section and the Target Worksheet now include the following two user editable metrics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Target S/T %</span>: Target Sales to Total Target Stock</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Min Pres</span>:  The initial value is seeded from Hierarchy Defaults in AP mode. In standalone mode, the values do not seed.  Only Hierarchy Defaults are used. Hierarchy Defaults by Cluster and Hierarchy Defaults by Time are not used.  </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="Emphasis">Target S/T %</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Min Pres</span> can be defaulted at the segment level in the segment definitions widget, and both values can be overwritten at the cluster set / cluster level in the Target Worksheet.</p>
        <p>Five new read-only Approximate Stock Unit metrics have been added to the Target Worksheet and Target New Choices grids. The metrics in the Target Worksheet are an aggregate for all new styles while in the <span class="Emphasis">Target New Choices</span> grid, the metrics show values per choice.</p>
        <p>To support differing strategic approaches to target stock levels at different organizations or product levels, there are two sets of metrics added to show approximate stock levels at stores at regular prices for new choices.</p>
        <p>Firstly, approximate stock levels are calculated based solely on sell-through (ST%) targets without concern for maintaining minimum presentation throughout regular price selling periods. In this scenario, saleable stock is gradually depleted by sales throughout the regular price selling period, which may not be an issue where shoppers have lots of choices and are willing to substitute one choice for another. This approach helps avoid having excess inventory at the end of the regular price selling period for all styles. The metrics supporting this logic are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Approx Stock Units (S/T %)</span>: TY Act New Sales Units / Target Sell Through %</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Approx Stock Units By Site (S/T %)</span>: Approx Stock Units (S/T%) / TY Plan Site Count</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Secondly, approximate stock levels are calculated with the requirements to have enough stock to meet sales and maintain a full minimum presentation throughout the regular price selling period. The metrics supporting this logic are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Approx Stock Units (Min Pres)</span>: TY Act New Sales Units + (TY Plan Site Count * Min Pres)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Approx Stock Units By Site (Min Pres)</span>: Approx Stock Units (Min Pres) / TY Plan Site Count</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Sales To Approx Stock Units (Min Pres)</span>: TY Act New Sales Units / Approx Stock Units (Min Pres)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An approximate stock target based on Sales plus Min Pres does not respond to a defined ST% target. The <span class="Emphasis">Sales To Approx Stock Units (Min Pres)</span> metric is an Approximate ST% allowing for a comparison of the result of the (Min Pres) calculations to an ST%.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">All 5 metrics are available for use as needed. If some of these metrics are not useful based on the strategy in place, those metrics can be hidden using the <span class="Emphasis">Fields</span> selector.</p>
        <h3>Improved target planning</h3>
        <p>As part of an effort to expand the usability of the Target Choice Count functionality, four existing read-only metrics within the Target Worksheet are now editable. Although all four metrics are editable and can be selected as visible with the <span class="Emphasis">Field</span> chooser, users can include 1 or more of these metrics within the Target Worksheet while not including the others.</p>
        <p>The metrics are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>TY Act New Sales $ % +/- Comparison</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>TY Act New Sales U % +/- Comparison</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Planning against <span class="Emphasis">+/- Comparison</span> supports use cases where the target should be planned against the entire product hierarchy within the Comparison or set the +/- to LY actualized Sales within the cluster set cluster. For example, planning Jeans to LY actualized Sales +20%.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>TY Act New Sales $ % +/- Comparison Active</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>TY Act New Sales U % +/- Comparison Active</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Planning against <span class="Emphasis">+/- Comparison Active</span> supports use cases where the target should be planned against only the Comparison Styles selected for inclusion in Comparison Active or set the +/- to LY actualized Sales for the styles designated for inclusion. For example, planning Core Jeans Styles +20%, rather than the entire hierarchy.</p>
        <p>If one of the <span class="Emphasis">% +/- Comparison Active</span> metrics is edited at the aggregate Cluster Set level, then all <span class="Emphasis">% +/- Comparison Active</span> metrics for Clusters within that Cluster Set will change while holding the relationship between the those Cluster Set/Clusters. A likely more appropriate way to make this change would be at the Cluster Set/Cluster level. This would target specific areas, rather than move the entire Cluster Set. However, changes at the aggregate level are supported and the Cluster relationships will hold.</p>
        <h4>Maintaining AUR</h4>
        <p>Existing logic that AUR is always held is maintained. For example, modifying <span class="Emphasis">TY Act New Sales $ % +/- Comparison Active</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>drives a new TY Act New Sales $ value</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>updates TY Act New Sales U, and</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>locks TY Act New AUR.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Improved control over one-off and poor performing variants</h3>
        <p>For TG JE v2023.2, the functionality associated with data cleansing in AP&#160;and Target Choice Count has been expanded with the addition of a new threshold and new fields that give users more control over one-off variants and habitual poor performers. </p>
        <p> The new data cleansing threshold, <span class="Emphasis">Active Variant Total Minimum</span>, lets users identify and remove consistently low sellers from the cleansing process. As with the other existing thresholds the default is set using a system policy. In this case, new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Cleanse: Active Variant Total Minimum</span> (Module: Target Choice Count). The default is used when segments are created. However, users can change the value at the segment level.</p>
        <p>
                        The <span class="Emphasis">Active Variant Total Minimum</span> functionality:
                        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>finds the total cleansed Active sales for all variants in the segment / cluster set / cluster</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>finds the average of these totals</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>multiplies the threshold to the average total to get the Minimum required</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>excludes any variants whose total is lower than this Minimum</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Selecting the <span class="Emphasis">View Data Cleansing Report</span> toolbar button displays the <span class="Emphasis">Target Data Cleansing</span> report. The <span class="Emphasis">Target Data Cleansing Settings</span> section displays the data cleansing parameters or thresholds, now including <span class="Emphasis">Active Variant Total Minimum</span>, that are used for each segment. The background color of the threshold fields corresponds to data points that were cleansed or altered as a result of each.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Target Data Cleansing Settings.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>For ease of use, all coloring rules used in the <span class="Emphasis">Target Data Cleansing</span> report have been modified to purple to be more streamlined. This makes it easier to cross reference the background color of the threshold fields against the data points that were cleansed or altered as a result of each.</p>

        </p>
        <h4>Choosing whether to rationalize placeholders</h4>
        <p>A new read-only checkbox labeled <span class="Emphasis">Carryover</span> allows users to decide whether to include or exclude given placeholders from processing. If an item is to be carried over, but is near the end of its life and thus has a minimal sales plan in the current time period, then users can include the item so that Rationalization is informed by the item’s performance and recommends new placeholders to take its place. If the item is a carryover but it is expected to continue to sell with the same volume as last year, then the item can be excluded because its plan is already created and accounted for.
			</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Active Variant Total Minimum.PNG" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>The method for population of the <span class="Emphasis">Carryover</span> field depends on whether Target Creation is accessed through AP or standalone Target Choice Count:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In AP, Carryover is based on whether the placeholder’s phase dates intersect both the scenario Window of Time and the Comparison time period. For example, if the Comparison time period is over 2022 week 1 - week 10, and the scenario is over 2023 week 1 - week 10, an item selling from 2022 week 5 to 2023 week 15 will be considered carryover, but an item that phases out in 2022 week 30 is not.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In standalone Target Choice Count, Carryover is calculated with the same logic as in AP, but uses Inventory level phase dates instead of placeholder phase dates. If at least one of the variant’s inventories' phase dates intersect both Window of Time and Comparison time frames, then the variant is considered carryover.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Excluding placeholders from rationalization post data cleansing</h4>
        <p>A new editable field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Inclusion Type</span> gives users the ability, even after data cleansing,  to manually exclude some placeholders from consideration in the rationalization process. For example, a placeholder was a very unique item whose trends are not expected to be repeated in the future. The default setting is <span class="Emphasis">Full Process</span>.</p>

        <h3>Using an additional attribute/group level to further align key strategies</h3>
        <p>Within Target Creation (and Target Choice Count),  the addition of an optional <span class="Emphasis">Segment Split Type</span> field that interacts with the <span class="Emphasis">Segment By Hierarchy</span> functionality means the <span class="Emphasis">Segment By Hierarchy</span> function can now apply down to an additional attribute/group level. This can be very helpful when creating targets which align to key strategies, such as: by brand, fashion, marketing program, or any product attribute as defined.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Assortment Planning/Segment Split Type Field.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Segment Split Type</span> field is available as a dropdown when creating or modifying target scenarios with the dropdown comprised of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Variant Hierarchy fields (but only those not a part of the configured Product Hierarchy)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Variant (for standalone TCC) or Placeholder (for AP) attribute fields - (only LOOKUP attribute types)</p>
                <p>When creating targets in AP, the entity in use is Placeholder (not Variant). There is no explicit assignment of hierarchy groups to Placeholders. Thus, if a Group type is chosen such as Brand, then the application will look up the Group value of the assigned variant. If there is no assigned variant, then the Lookup value is <span class="Emphasis">None</span>.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="BasicNote">The option <span class="Emphasis">(None)</span> is intended to be used to clear previously selected options.  </p>
        <p>If no attribute is selected, then <span class="Emphasis">Segment By Hierarchy</span> works the same as it did previously. It creates one segment for each of the lowest hierarchy levels of the Product Hierarchy selection. If an attribute is chosen, then segments are created on a cross section of hierarchy levels and the attribute selected. For example, if <span class="Emphasis">Brand</span> is chosen, then the segments are the combinations of product hierarchy levels and brands.</p>
        <h4>Segment names and descriptions</h4>
        <p>If segments are generated with an attribute selected in the <span class="Emphasis">Segment Split Type</span> field, then a column automatically displays with the selected attribute name as the column header, with the individual values shown in the column contents.</p>
        <p>When segments are generated via <span class="Emphasis">Segment By Hierarchy</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Segment Split Type</span>, the automatically generated segment names and descriptions are <span class="Emphasis">&lt;product hierarchy code&gt; / &lt;split type code&gt;</span> and <span class="Emphasis">&lt;product hierarchy description&gt; / &lt;split type description&gt;</span>.</p>

        <h3>Breaking Changes</h3>
        <h4>ROS extrapolation updated to avoid crossing zero</h4>
        <p>Within Target Choice Count/Creation, previous functionality was to rationalize the comparison ROS values and make placeholder ROS recommendations to the point where additional recommendations are not mathematically justified. Beyond that point, if a user wished to add additional placeholders, the logic was to create a decreasing ROS slope to be applied against additional, user-requested recommendations. A function of the previous slope method was that the slope could reach or cross a zero (or negative) ROS. </p>
        <p>The logic used to create the extended slope for ROS values to be applied against additional placeholders has been updated in such a way that it will never reach or cross zero. This allows users to create additional placeholders and receive suggested ROS values for each placeholder, regardless of the number of additional placeholders being requested. Creating a large amount of additional placeholders could result in very small ROS values for some placeholders. This is a function of a decreasing ROS slope.</p>
        <h2>2023.3</h2>
        <h3>Edit Target Scenario view work flow improvement</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Edit Target Scenario</span> toolbar buttons have been reordered to follow a more natural flow through Target planning, and the icons have been changed to have blue icons for in-screen actions and black icons for pop-up-view actions.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Edit Target Scenario Toolbar Buttons.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h3>Making recommendations using Collection level data</h3>
        <p>The existing functionality limited the choice count to using style level information to make recommendations. This functionality has been broadened with a new option to allow the choice count to make recommendations based on collection level information rather than style level information.  To use the new option, select a new checkbox labeled <span class="Emphasis">Use Collection For Intra-Style Curve?</span> that has been added to the <span class="Emphasis">Create Target Scenario</span> window. Style level information is used if the checkbox is left unchecked. </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Use Collection Level Data.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The default of whether the checkbox is pre-selected or unselected is set using new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Default: Use Collection For Intra-Style Curve</span> (Module: Target Choice Count). Users can choose to override the default as necessary. </p>
        <p>When changing the property on an existing scenario (that is in Rationalized or Smart Started status), a message displays to inform users that they will need to Rationalize again to update the recommendations based on the new value.</p>
        <h3>Creating floor set updates for varying time frames</h3>
        <p>Target Creation (Assortment Planning or standalone Target Choice Count), provides a connection between MFP plan targets and  an Assortment plan. This tool provides recommended choices, by cluster, using defined parameters. In previous functionality, choice recommendations were made using a defined Window of Time as the selling period for all recommendations. Within that structure (all choices being active during all selected periods), Target Scenarios had to be broken into multiple periods of time to get recommendations for a full season of choices. 

		</p>
        <p>To better support the work flow and processes of Assortment planning activities, Target Creation has been enhanced to allow users to define multiple floor set updates with their own windows of time within the selected overall  period of time of a Target Scenario. 

		</p>
        <p>An example of this is a scenario with a 6-month window of time representing the Spring assortment, but further broken down into four floor set update periods corresponding to floor sets/product updates. The result being choice recommendations for each of those update periods.

		</p>
        <p>To support the continuation of a choice selling across update periods, choices can be merged across update periods. For example, a choice recommendation from update period one, can be connected to a choice recommendation from update period two. This signifies that a single choice carries across periods of time, and one of the recommended choices is fulfilled in each update window.</p>
        <p>The new functionality is made possible with the addition of a new widget labeled <span class="Emphasis">Segment Floor Set Updates</span> on the right of the <span class="Emphasis">Edit Target Scenario</span> view (whether creating a new or copying an existing scenario). </p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Segment Floor Set Updates.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>As floor set updates are segment-specific, segments must be created first. Therefore, users must click on segments for which updates are to be created and then use the <span class="Emphasis">Segment Floor Set Updates</span> widget to configure the updates. Users have the option to assign the same update to all segments by selecting all segments or configure different updates by segment by clicking on one segment or smaller subsets of segments at a time.</p>
        <p>Fields within the new widget include:</p>

        <h3>Viewing floor set update results

        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Update</span> field has been added to each of the lower tabs in the <span class="Emphasis">Edit Target Scenario</span> view for scenarios with updates created (Target Worksheet, Target New Choices, and Results Matrix). For example,</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Target Choice Count/Target Worksheet Update Field.png" class="LargeImages">
            </img>
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, the <span class="Emphasis">Target Scenario List</span> grid has a new field labeled <span class="Emphasis">Updates</span> which lists any configured update periods. </p>
        <h3>Merging placeholder choices</h3>
        <p>Building on the new ability to create floor set updates for varying time frames, planners can merge the choice recommendations for each of those update periods so that styles can continue across multiple updates before phasing out. While planners might define monthly updates which allow for the introduction of newness each month, it is very rare that the entire product offering will be replaced at each of these updates. It is more common that many choices will live through multiple updates, perhaps 3 or 4 monthly updates.</p>
        <p>The choice count recommendations given are initially independent of each other. Meaning update 1 might recommend 6 choices, and update 2 might recommend 8 choices. This can be accomplished by phasing out all 6 choices and introducing 8 new choices OR by merging choices 1-6 from update 1 with choices 1-6 of update 2, resulting in a longer in-phase window for those choices, and allowing for the introduction of two new choices within update 2. The merging function supports this common use case.</p>
        <p>After the merging is done as desired, the combination of the updates by period of time provides a choice count for each. The remaining choice recommendations can be used for newness.</p>
        <p>To view and merge choices, select the new <span class="Emphasis">View Choices By Update</span> toolbar button to display the new <span class="Emphasis">Target Choices By Update</span> view.</p>
        <h3>Target Choices By Update view</h3>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Target Choices By Update</span> view, comprised of four widgets, lets users select which segments and locations to work with.  Check the <span class="Emphasis">Sum Locations</span> check box to sum locations.  When checked, the data displayed collapses to show choices across all selected locations. When unchecked, specific values are broken out for the selected locations.</p>

                <p><span class="Emphasis">Pareto Choices</span>: A Pareto percentage of Comparison Active choices. Intended as a guidepost for the scenario’s TY New choices. Ideally, the choice count for comparison and the current scenario should align. The Pareto percentage to use can be set in two places, via: </p>

                        </p>This threshold answers the question, “In history, what number of variants were required to achieve X% of the total target productivity?”  This is meant to be an estimate against which scenario results can be compared.  If the scenario were to achieve 95% of the target, how many total choices are necessary?</li>

Comparison Active variants are sorted by productivity
in descending order, the variant that causes the
cumulative sum to meet this percent of total is the
Pareto Choice Count. For example, if the Pareto
Threshold is 95%, and when rationalizing, the 37th
variant has a cumulative productivity that is 95.4% of
total productivity, the system will determine 37 as the
Pareto Choice Count. Formatted as a decimal (e.g.
0.95 = 95%).</td>
