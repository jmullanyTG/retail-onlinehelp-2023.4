        <h1>Target Choice Count</h1>
        <h2>Viewing the approximate average stock per choice</h2>
        <p>The following metrics further define metrics added in TG JE v2023.2. Previously, metrics showed <span class="Emphasis">Approx Stock Units By Site</span> (S/T% and Min Pres), which are site totals across all choices. These new metrics utilize an additional divisor for <span class="Emphasis">TY Act New Choices</span>, to provide averages per choice:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Avg Approx Stock Units By Choice By Site (S/T %)</span>: Approx Stock Units (S/T%) / TY Plan Site Count / TY Act New Choices</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="Emphasis">Avg Approx Stock Units By Choice By Site (Min Pres)</span>: Approx Stock Units (Min Pres) / TY Plan Site Count / TY Act New Choices</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
