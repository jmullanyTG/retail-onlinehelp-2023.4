        <h1>R Engine</h1>
        <h2>Call to URL reverting back to an existing system policy </h2>
        <p>The use of the R Engine within the Compute Node Manager has been deprecated with the call to get the URL reverting back to the previously existing system policy. The reason is that R Engine as it is used today does not go through the Compute Node Manager. Instead, the R Engine goes through a separate dispatch broker call. The system policy, labeled <span class="Emphasis">The RScript Service URL</span> (Module: Allocation), was previously hidden but is now visible.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">For more information regarding the system policy, see <cite>System Policies</cite>.</p>
