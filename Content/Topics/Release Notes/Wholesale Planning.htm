        <h1>Wholesale Planning</h1>
        <p>Wholesale planners managing wholesale accounts can have accounts that split demand between multiple DCs. This functions similarly to TG JE's demand transference, though in this case wholesale accounts transfer their sales into DCs and not stores with demand aggregating to DCs only.</p>
        <p>Wholesale accounts don’t have a sales history. Instead, these accounts use sell-ins (customer orders) in place of sales history for forecasting purposes and are managed by grouping multiple sell-ins together into major accounts. Only the major accounts are forecast and replenished.. For example,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Vandelay Industries (the primary wholesale account)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>BrandA</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>BrandB</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>BrandC</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Vandelay Industries is the major account and is the account that is forecast and replenished.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Wholesale Planning</h2>
        <h3>Using customer orders as sales history for Customers <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">DMDEV-88190</MadCap:conditionalText></h3>
        <p>A new weekly task, <span class="Emphasis">(WS) (Weekly) Generate Sales History from Customer Orders</span>, uses customer orders that happened in the past as sales history if the customer order went to an account. The relationships defined in Customer Manager determine how Customer data rolls into which accounts.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Customer orders with dates in the future are ignored.</p>
        <h2>Site Clustering</h2>
        <p>There is a new Cluster Type in the Site Clustering Module labeled <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale Account Cluster</span>. How sites are selected remains unchanged and is the same as with the other previously existing Cluster Types. Users do not select or create wholesale account clusters within the UI as these are automatically created within the import process. However, users will need to open new wholesale account cluster sets and click <span class="Emphasis">Calculate</span> to assign the correct clusters. Snapshots continue as normal.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Editing a Cluster Set will show the Classifications created.</p>
        <h2>Site Manager</h2>
        <h3>Reviewing the customers under an Account site type</h3>
        <p>Wholesale planners can, when managing wholesale accounts,  see the customer names for sites of type <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> by selecting a new widget <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Customer Relations</span>. The customer names are read-only as changes to the Customer Account relationship are performed in Customer Manager.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Sites that are not of site type Account do not display any results.</p>
        <h3>Splitting Account demand into different DCs</h3>
        <p>A new widget labeled <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Source Site Contribution</span> displays a cross product of items in the hierarchy and all DCs. This widget lets users review the default contribution factor (or split percentage) derived from past customer imports and override the default contributions on a particular hierarchy level as desired. However, an override itself cannot be overridden. </p>
        <p>After a user enters a value in the <span class="Emphasis">Override</span> field and clicks <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>, the <span class="Emphasis">Clear Override</span> field for that row is formatted orange. The <span class="Emphasis">Clear Override</span> functionality clears overrides for all the DCs for the item. When overrides are cleared the default contribution percentage is used.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If 10,000 units have a 50/50 split between 2 DCs out of a total of 4 DCs, then 5,000 units are sent to each of the 2 DCs.</p>
        <p>A new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Site Wholesale Account Distribution: ItemMaster Hierarchy ID</span> defines the hierarchy used. (For more information, see the <cite>System Policies</cite> section.). Also, a new job task <span class="Emphasis">(WS) (Weekly) Calculate Source Site Percent Contribution for Accounts</span> must be configured.</p>
        <h2>Supplier Manager</h2>
        <h3>Reviewing construction type data</h3>
        <p>A new blade labeled <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Construction Type Capacity</span> has been added to the main view in the Supplier Manager module. Selecting a supplier in the top grid refreshes the blade to display imported construction type data relating to that supplier. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">A Construction type is an Item Master Group that defines what kind of manufacturing can product the item.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Supplier/Supplier Construction Type Capacity Widget.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Each supplier can have multiple construction types and multiple construction groups associated with them. For example,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Supplier 1: (V-necks, T-shirts, and Tank Tops)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Supplier 2: (T-shirts, Dress-shirts, and Collar Shirts)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The supplier and the construction types that the supplier can provide are visible in a new blade within Order Manager labeled <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Capacity Report</span>. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">New system policy <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Constraint: Construction Type</span> (Module: Order Manager) is used to configure the Attribute ID&#160;for the construction type.</p>
        <h3>Specifying capacities in buckets</h3>
        <p>Additionally, a second widget labeled <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Construction Type Capacity</span> has been added to the Supplier Manager module. When a planner selects a supplier, time displays in the X-axis and construction type in the Y-axis. </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Only the <span class="Emphasis">Total Supplier Quantity</span> field is editable with all other columns being read-only. Planners can multi-select cells in the <span class="Emphasis">Total Supplier Quantity</span> field to specify the capacity in that bucket.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">New system policy <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Constraint: Bucket Type</span> (Module: Order Manager) defines which Bucket ID to use that represents the time period. The bucket range is based on today and the value for existing system policy <span class="Emphasis">Future Days</span> (Engine: Forecasts).</p>
        <h2>Customer Manager</h2>
        <p>For TG JE v2023.4, the Customer Account Manager module was renamed Customer Manager to reflect updates that support Wholesale planning. The enhanced functionality means sites can be set up as an account and displayed using the <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> site type in Site Manager. For example, </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Users then maintain the Customer entity and do the linking in Customer Manager. Within Customer Manager, the site represents the account with customers rolling up into accounts. Customers are grouped 1 to 20 like other entities that can be used to show a hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Two new fields <span class="Emphasis">Account Name</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> located under the <span class="Emphasis">Customer Account</span> group can be added to the top grid in the Customer Manager Document. Both fields are editable and have the <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span> right-click menu option. The value in the <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> field can be used within Assortment Planning.</p>
        <h2>Merchandise Financial Planning</h2>
        <p>Within MFP, TG JE v2023.4 introduces a new Channel labeled <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale</span>, with the ability to add sub-channel hierarchies beneath <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale</span> for use in individual plans by account.</p>
        <h3>Including wholesale totals in the hierarchy</h3>
        <p>If the desired functionality is to include wholesale accounts in MFP but not plan them individually, then all that is necessary to do is include the Channel group in the MFP hierarchy configuration. Then Wholesale will be available when hierarchies are generated.</p>
        <h3>Including Individual wholesale accounts in the hierarchy</h3>
        <p>To include Wholesale in the Channel Hierarchy, the following steps must be taken:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>One of the Site Groups 1 - 20 should be used to represent each wholesale account.  For example, <span class="Emphasis">Site Group 7</span> is given the friendly name <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale Account</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/Site Group Representing Wholesale Account.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Import Site Group values that exactly match each Account, and assign that SiteGroupID value to each wholesale account site.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">All Retail sites / DCs / other sites will have value of 0, No SiteGroup.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Include the Site Group level in the Global Groups configuration in MFP.</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/Site Group Level Global Groups Configuration.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Users can then view individual Wholesale Accounts in the MFP hierarchy.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/View Wholesale Accounts Maintain Financial Plan.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h3>Sites and customer accounts</h3>
        <p>Sites and Customer Accounts cannot co-mingle in MFP.  Data for wholesale accounts can exist in their own hierarchy levels alongside retail hierarchy levels, but at the leaf level, they cannot intersect.  For example, if the brand is <span class="Emphasis">ToolsGroup Tees</span>, the Toolsgroup Tees-owned retail site Irvine and the Customer Account called <span class="Emphasis">Irvine Sport Shop</span> that resells ToolsGroup Tees branded items cannot both exist in the <span class="Emphasis">Total Company &gt; USA &gt; Southwest</span> Channel.  </p>
        <p>The hierarchy must be further divided to separate sites and accounts, or hierarchy levels with mixtures must be excluded. If a mixed hierarchy level is included, the following message displays:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/Sites and Customer Accounts Mixed.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h2>Inventory Manager</h2>
        <p>Wholesale Accounts can be easily identified within an Inventory Manager document. Select <span class="Emphasis">Choose</span> on the toolbar and include <span class="Emphasis">Site Type</span> from the <span class="Emphasis">Site Type</span> metadata group. The <span class="Emphasis">Site Type</span> column displays <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> for wholesale accounts.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="Site Type.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <p>Detailed forecast data can be viewed by navigating to the <span class="Emphasis">Forecast Viewer</span> blade and reviewing the <span class="Emphasis">Account Forecast</span> series.</p>
        <h2>Order Manager</h2>
        <p>Planners can now see all the different suppliers for a selected order line based on the order line's  construction type (construction types have a 1-to-1 relationship to items), the production capacity of each supplier over time, and how much of the production capacity is being used already by authorized orders.</p>
        <p>When an order line is selected, the new <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Capacity Report </span> blade populates with all the suppliers that have the order line’s construction type.  Planners can review how much production capacity is left for each supplier of the construction type and how much of the capacity is taken up by pending stock. Supply planners can also manage scenarios where all suppliers are unable to fulfill the order so that exceptions are managed effectively.</p>
        <h3>Supplier production constraints</h3>
        <p>Often times a wholesaler’s constraint lies with supplier production. In this scenario and bearing in mind each supplier can produce X amount of construction types a month, a supply planner:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> looks at all the unconstrained orders today

</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>adjusts the order quantity based on constraints such as

production capacity or orders for a particular vendor has been particularly low.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Planners can run a new macro <span class="Emphasis">Apply Supplier Production Limitation</span> and the values in the <span class="Emphasis">User Order Quantity</span> field in the top grid update according to the supplier production limit of that construction type. The <span class="Emphasis">Supplier Capacity Report</span> displays recommended orders for today without any supplier constraint applied. Planners can review and apply supplier constraints to recommended orders as needed. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Both Replenishment and Assortment Planning orders can have supplier constraints applied to them. </p>
        <p>Order lines that go beyond a supplier's production capacity split with the excess overflowing to another supplier of the same construction type. The resulting multiple order lines have the same order date, but different order quantities. Order quantities that exceed all available supplier capacity default to a supplier called <span class="Emphasis">Unfulfilled Supplier</span> which shows the unfulfillable capacity.</p>
        <p>The Order Date defines which recommended order lines of the same construction type are processed first with the earliest order date going first. The order in which suppliers are used to fulfill a construction type is dictated by the supplier construction priority provided during import.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Dates do not change. Therefore, policies such as schedules and lead time do not apply. However, policy <span class="Emphasis">Inventory Policy: Order Multiple and Min Order Quantity</span> does apply.</p>
