        <h2>Site Manager</h2>
        <h3>Reviewing the customers under an Account site type</h3>
        <p>Wholesale planners can, when managing wholesale accounts,  see the customer names for sites of type <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> by selecting a new widget <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Customer Relations</span>. The customer names are read-only as changes to the Customer Account relationship are performed done in Customer Manager.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Sites that are not of site type Account do not display any results.</p>
        <h3>Splitting Account demand into different DCs</h3>
        <p>A new widget labeled <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Source Site Contribution</span> displays a cross product of items in the hierarchy and all DCs. This widget lets users review the default contribution factor (or split percentage) derived from past customer imports and override the default contributions as desired. However, an override itself cannot be overridden. </p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If 10,000 units have a 50/50 split between 2 DCs out of a total of 4 DCs, then 5,000 units are sent to each of the 2 DCs.</p>
        <p>A new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Site Wholesale Account Distribution: ItemMaster Hierarchy ID</span> defines the hierarchy used. (For more information, see the <cite>System Policies</cite> section.)</p>
        <p>New job task <span class="Emphasis">(WS) (Weekly) Calculate Source Site Percent Contribution for Accounts</span></p>
        <h2>Customer Manager</h2>
        <p>For TG JE v2023.4, the Customer Account Manager was renamed Customer Manager to reflect updates that support Wholesale planning. The enhanced functionality means sites can be set up as an account and displayed using the <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> site type in Site Manager. Users then maintain the Customer entity and do the linking in Customer Manager. Within Customer Manager, the site represents the account with customers rolling up into accounts. Customers are grouped 1 to 20 like other entities that can be used to show a hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Two new fields <span class="Emphasis">Account Name</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> located under the <span class="Emphasis">Customer Account</span> group can be added to the top grid in the Customer Manager Document. Both fields are editable and have the <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span> right-click menu option. The value in the <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> field can be used within Assortment Planning.</p>
