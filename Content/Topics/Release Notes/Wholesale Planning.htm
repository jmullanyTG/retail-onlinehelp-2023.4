        <h1>Wholesale Planning</h1>
        <p>Wholesale planners managing wholesale accounts can have accounts that split demand between multiple DCs. This functions similarly to TG JE's demand transference, though in this case wholesale accounts transfer their sales into DCs and not stores with demand aggregating to DCs only.</p>
        <p>Wholesale accounts don’t have sales history instead using sell-ins (customer orders) as sale history for forecasting purposes.

These wholesale accounts are managed by grouping multiple sell-ins together into major Accounts and only forecast and replenish those major Accounts. For example,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Vandelay Industries (the primary wholesale account)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>BrandA</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>BrandB</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>BrandC</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Wholesale Planning</h2>
        <h3>Using customer orders as sales history for Customers <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.DoNotPublish">DMDEV-88190</MadCap:conditionalText></h3>
        <p>A new weekly task, <span class="Emphasis">(WS) (Weekly) Generate Sales History from Customer Orders</span>, uses customer orders that happened in the past as sales history if the customer order went to an account. The relationships defined in Customer Manager determine how Customer data rolls into which accounts.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Customer orders with dates in the future are ignored.</p>
        <h2>Site Clustering</h2>
        <p>There is a new Cluster Type in the Site Clustering Module labeled <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale Account Cluster</span>. How sites are selected remains unchanged and is the same as with the other previously existing Cluster Types. Users do not select or create Clusters within the UI as these are automatically created within the import process. However, users will need to open new Wholesale Account Cluster sets and click <span class="Emphasis">Calculate</span> to assign the correct Clusters. Snapshots continue as normal.</p>
        <p>Editing a Cluster Set will show the Classifications created.</p>
        <h2>Site Manager</h2>
        <h3>Reviewing the customers under an Account site type</h3>
        <p>Wholesale planners can, when managing wholesale accounts,  see the customer names for sites of type <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> by selecting a new widget <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Customer Relations</span>. The customer names are read-only as changes to the Customer Account relationship are performed done in Customer Manager.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">Sites that are not of site type Account do not display any results.</p>
        <h3>Splitting Account demand into different DCs</h3>
        <p>A new widget labeled <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Source Site Contribution</span> displays a cross product of items in the hierarchy and all DCs. This widget lets users review the default contribution factor (or split percentage) derived from past customer imports and override the default contributions on  particular hierarchy level as desired. However, an override itself cannot be overridden. </p>
        <p>After a user enters a value in the <span class="Emphasis">Override</span> field and clicks <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>, the <span class="Emphasis">Clear Override</span> field for that row is formatted orange. The Clear Override functionality clears overrides for all the DCs for the item. When overrides are cleared the default contribution percentage is used.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If 10,000 units have a 50/50 split between 2 DCs out of a total of 4 DCs, then 5,000 units are sent to each of the 2 DCs.</p>
        <p>A new system policy <span class="Emphasis">Site Wholesale Account Distribution: ItemMaster Hierarchy ID</span> defines the hierarchy used. (For more information, see the <cite>System Policies</cite> section.)</p>
        <p>New job task <span class="Emphasis">(WS) (Weekly) Calculate Source Site Percent Contribution for Accounts</span></p>
        <h2>Customer Manager</h2>
        <p>For TG JE v2023.4, the Customer Account Manager module was renamed Customer Manager to reflect updates that support Wholesale planning. The enhanced functionality means sites can be set up as an account and displayed using the <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> site type in Site Manager. For example, </p>
        <p>Users then maintain the Customer entity and do the linking in Customer Manager. Within Customer Manager, the site represents the account with customers rolling up into accounts. Customers are grouped 1 to 20 like other entities that can be used to show a hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Two new fields <span class="Emphasis">Account Name</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> located under the <span class="Emphasis">Customer Account</span> group can be added to the top grid in the Customer Manager Document. Both fields are editable and have the <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span> right-click menu option. The value in the <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> field can be used within Assortment Planning.</p>
        <h2>Merchandise Financial Planning</h2>
        <p>Wholesale has been added as a Channel within MFP, with the ability to add sub-channel hierarchies beneath Wholesale for used for individual plans by account.</p>
        <h3>Include Wholesale Totals in Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>If the desired functionality is to include wholesale accounts in MFP, but not plan them individually, then all that is necessary is to include the Channel group in the MFP hierarchy configuration. Then Wholesale will be available when hierarchies are generated.</p>
        <h3>Include Individual Wholesale Accounts in Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>To include Wholesale in the Channel Hierarchy, the following steps must be taken:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>One of the Site Groups 1 - 20 should be used to represent each wholesale account.  For example, <span class="Emphasis">Site Group 7</span> is given the friendly name <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale Account</span>:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/Site Group Representing Wholesale Account.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Import Site Group values that exactly match each Account, and assign that SiteGroupID value to each wholesale account site.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">All Retail sites / DCs / other sites will have value of 0, No SiteGroup.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Include the Site Group level in the Global Groups configuration in MFP:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/Site Group Level Global Groups Configuration.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Users will be able to view individual Wholesale Accounts in the MFP hierarchy:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/View Wholesale Accounts Maintain Financial Plan.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h3>Sites and customer accounts</h3>
        <p>Sites and Customer Accounts cannot co-mingle in MFP.  Data for wholesale accounts can exist in their own hierarchy levels alongside retail hierarchy levels, but at the leaf level, they cannot intersect.  For example, if the brand is ToolsGroup Tees, the Toolsgroup Tees-owned retail site Irvine and the Customer Account called “Irvine Sport Shop” that resells ToolsGroup Tees branded items cannot both exist in the Total Company &gt; USA &gt; Southwest Channel.  </p>
        <p>The hierarchy must be further divided to separate sites and accounts, or hierarchy levels with mixtures must be excluded. If a mixed hierarchy level is included, the following message displays:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/Sites and Customer Accounts Mixed.png" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
