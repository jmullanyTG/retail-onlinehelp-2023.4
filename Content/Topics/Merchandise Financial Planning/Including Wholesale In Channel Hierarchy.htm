        <h1>Including Wholesale in a Channel hierarchy</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale</span> Channel can be included in a hierarchy along with sub-channel hierarchies beneath <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale</span> for use in individual plans by account.</p>
        <p>If the desired functionality is to include wholesale accounts in MFP, but not plan them individually, then all that is necessary is to include the Channel group in the MFP hierarchy configuration. Then Wholesale will be available when hierarchies are generated.</p>
        <p>To include Wholesale in the Channel Hierarchy, the following steps must be taken:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>One of the Site Groups 1 - 20 should be used to represent each wholesale account.  For example, <span class="Emphasis">Site Group 7</span> is given the friendly name <span class="Emphasis">Wholesale Account</span>:</p>

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Import Site Group values that exactly match each Account, and assign that SiteGroupID value to each wholesale account site.</p>
                <p class="BasicNote">All Retail sites / DCs / other sites will have value of 0, No SiteGroup.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Include the Site Group level in the Global Groups configuration in MFP:</p>
                <p>
                    <img src="../../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/Site Group Level Global Groups Configuration.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Users can then view individual Wholesale Accounts in the MFP hierarchy:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Wholesale Planning/View Wholesale Accounts Maintain Financial Plan.PNG" class="LargeImages" />
        </p>
        <h3>Sites and customer accounts</h3>
        <p>Sites and Customer Accounts cannot co-mingle in MFP.  Data for wholesale accounts can exist in their own hierarchy levels alongside retail hierarchy levels, but at the leaf level, they cannot intersect.  For example, if the brand is ToolsGroup Tees, the Toolsgroup Tees-owned retail site Irvine and the Customer Account called “Irvine Sport Shop” that resells ToolsGroup Tees branded items cannot both exist in the Total Company &gt; USA &gt; Southwest Channel.  </p>
        <p>The hierarchy must be further divided to separate sites and accounts, or hierarchy levels with mixtures must be excluded. If a mixed hierarchy level is included, the following message displays:</p>
