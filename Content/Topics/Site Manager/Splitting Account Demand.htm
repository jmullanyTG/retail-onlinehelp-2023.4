        <h1>Splitting Account demand into different DCs</h1>
        <p>The <span class="Emphasis">Site Account Source Site Contribution</span> blade displays a cross product of items in the hierarchy and all DCs. Users can review the default contribution factor (or split percentage) derived from past customer imports and override the default contributions on  particular hierarchy level as desired. However, an override itself cannot be overridden. </p>
        <p>After a user enters a value in the <span class="Emphasis">Override</span> field and clicks <span class="Emphasis">Save</span>, the <span class="Emphasis">Clear Override</span> field for that row is formatted orange. The <span class="Emphasis">Clear Override</span> functionality clears overrides for all the DCs for the item. When overrides are cleared the default contribution percentage is used.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">If 10,000 units have a 50/50 split between 2 DCs out of a total of 4 DCs, then 5,000 units are sent to each of the 2 DCs.</p>
        <p>System policy <span class="Emphasis">Site Wholesale Account Distribution: ItemMaster Hierarchy ID</span> defines the hierarchy used.</p>
