        <h1>Price Matrix Overview</h1>
        <p>The Price Matrix view displays a set of pre-approved Price Points across multiple currency and country combinations. The goal is to avoid very complex price conversions.</p>
        <p>The Price Matrix takes an input value and, based on rules,  adjusts the value accordingly. If pricing for multiple stores in different currency and country combinations, the system looks across the matrix and finds the value for the currency and country combination.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">With the applicable user rights, the Price Point Matrix screen can be used to define a default Price Matrix that is assigned to a new Price Action. The assigned default can be changed later. </p>
