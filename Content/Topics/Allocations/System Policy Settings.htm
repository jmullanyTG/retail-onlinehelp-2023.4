        <h1>System policy settings</h1>
        <p>Several system policy vales must be set for the Allocations Module to function correctly. These policy values must be addressed as part of the business solution design process, or the IT solution design process. </p>
        <h2>R Engine: Call to get the URL</h2>
        <p>The use of the R Engine within the Compute Node Manager was deprecated with the call to get the URL reverting back to previously existing system policy <span class="Emphasis">The RScript Service URL</span> (Module: Allocation). The reason is that R Engine did not go through the Compute Node Manager. It goes through a separate dispatch broker call.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">This system policy was previously hidden but is now visible.</p>
