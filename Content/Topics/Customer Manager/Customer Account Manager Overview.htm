        <h1>Customer Manager </h1>
        <p>Sites can be set up as an account and displayed using the <span class="Emphasis">Account</span> site type in Site Manager. Users then maintain the Customer entity and do the linking in Customer Manager. Within Customer Manager, the site represents the account with customers rolling up into accounts. Customers are grouped 1 to 20 like other entities that can be used to show a hierarchy.</p>
        <p>Using the <span class="Emphasis">Choose Fields</span> functionality, two fields <span class="Emphasis">Account Name</span> and <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> located under the <span class="Emphasis">Customer Account</span> group can be added to the top grid in the Customer Manager Document. Both fields are editable and have the <span class="Emphasis">Multiple Changes</span> right-click menu option. The value in the <span class="Emphasis">Location Count</span> field can be used within Assortment Planning.</p>
        <p class="BasicNote">The usual rights (seen in variant manager, variant customer manager, etc) need to be associated to the module so that it displays.</p>
